IOSACal: open source radiocarbon calibration
============================================

IOSACal is an open source tool for radiocarbon calibration. It has a
command-line program::

  $ iosacal -d 7505 -s 93 --id "P-769"

which also creates nice plots like this::

  $ iosacal -d 7505 -s 93 --id "P-769" -p

.. image:: /images/P-769_7505_93.png

The same features are available as a Python 3 library::

  >>> from iosacal import R
  >>> from iosacal.text import single_text
  >>> r = R(7505, 93, 'P-769')
  >>> cal_r = r.calibrate('intcal13')
  >>> single_text(cal_r)

  # P-769

  Calibration of P-769: 7505 ± 93 BP

  ## Calibrated age

  Atmospheric data from Reimer et al (2013);

  ### 68.2% probability

  * 8392 CalBP ‒ 8284 CalBP (45.6%)
  * 8264 CalBP ‒ 8205 CalBP (22.3%)

  ### 95.4% probability

  * 8516 CalBP ‒ 8493 CalBP (1.1%)
  * 8480 CalBP ‒ 8157 CalBP (92.7%)
  * 8115 CalBP ‒ 8114 CalBP (0.1%)
  * 8089 CalBP ‒ 8058 CalBP (1.5%)

  IOSACal v0.2

Multiple determinations from the same event can be checked for
consistency and combined::

  >>> from iosacal import R, combine
  >>> from iosacal.text import single_text
  >>> r1 = R(4430, 100, 'Birm-637')
  >>> r2 = R(4430, 120, 'Birm-638')
  >>> r3 = R(4400, 100, 'Birm-639')
  >>> r4 = R(4350, 130, 'Birm-636')
  >>> r_combined = combine([r1, r2, r3, r4])
  >>> print(r_combined)

  RadiocarbonSample( Combined from Birm-637, Birm-638, Birm-639, Birm-636 with test statistic 0.287 : 4406 ± 55 )

  >>> r_combined_cal = r_combined.calibrate('intcal13')
  >>> print(single_text(r_combined_cal))

  # Combined from Birm-637, Birm-638, Birm-639, Birm-636 with test statistic 0.287

  Calibration of Combined from Birm-637, Birm-638, Birm-639, Birm-636 with test statistic 0.287: 4406.465763017056 ± 55.163983474505095 BP

  IOSACal v0.2

IOSACal can be `used interactively with Jupyter Notebook
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/steko/60b18bcb87c9202384d9>`_
(formerly known as IPython Notebook).

Install
-------

If you have Python 3 just::

  pip3 install iosacal

or get the source at https://gitlab.com/iosa/iosacal.

If none of the above makes sense, follow the :doc:`install` instructions.

Why another 14C calibration software ?
--------------------------------------

Most available programs for radiocarbon calibration, like OxCal, CALIB
and others, are *freeware*. You don't have to pay for them, but on the other
side you're not free to modify them as you need, nor to access and study the
source code.

This is the main motivation behind IOSACal: creating a free-as-in-freedom
radiocarbon calibration software, with a clean programming library,
that enables experiments and integration in existing archaeological
information systems.

Furthermore, writing this software from scratch is an alternative way of
learning how 14C calibration works, not only in strict mathematical terms,
but also from a practical point of view.

Features
--------

IOSACal takes a radiocarbon determination and outputs a calibrated age as a set
of probability intervals. A radiocarbon date is represented by a date in years
BP (before present, that is before 1950 AD) and a standard deviation, like
2430±170. The combination of these two values is a numerical representation of
a laboratory measure performed on the original organic material.

The main task of the calibration process is to convert this measure into a set
of calendar dates by means of a calibration curve. Users can choose whether
they want results as a plot, a short textual summary or both (the plot includes
the summary).

IOSACal reads calibration curves in the common ``.14c`` format used also by
other programs. Should you have calibration data in another format, it would be
easy to either convert them to that format or modify the source code of IOSACal
to adapt it to your needs.

IOSACal is based on current calibration methods, like those described in
[RAM2008]_.
