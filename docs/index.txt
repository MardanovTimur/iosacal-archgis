GNUCal, a radiocarbon calibration program
=========================================

GNUCal is a radiocarbon (14C) calibration program. It can run natively
on any platform where the Python interpreter is available, including
all GNU/Linux distributions, MacOS X and other UNIX operating systems,
and Microsoft Windows.

What does it do?
----------------

GNUCal takes a radiocarbon determination, typically composed by a date
in years BP (before present, i.e. before 1950 AD) and a standard
deviation measure, and outputs a calibrated age as a set of
probability intervals either to the console or to an image with
plots. The calibration method is based on current literature.

GNUCal reads calibration curves in the common ``.14c`` format used
also by OxCal and CALIB for better compatibility.

Why GNUCal
----------

Most available programs for radiocarbon calibration, like OxCal, CALIB
and others, are *freeware*. So, you don't have to pay for them, but
you're not free to use and modify them as you need.

This is the motivation behind GNUCal: creating a free-as-in-freedom
radiocarbon calibration program, with a clean programming library,
that enables experiments and integration in existing archaeological
information systems.

Get GNUCal
----------

GNUCal is still in its infancy. The 0.1 version will be released
soon, but in the meantime you can get the development version from
bitbucket_, either with the `complete project history`_ or as a
simple `source archive`_.

GNUCal isn't yet structured as a Python package, so you don't have to
*install* it. Just extract the source into a folder and you'll be able
to run it straight from there, using the command line interface.

Calibration resources
---------------------

There are some interesting websites to learn about radiocarbon
calibration and related topics. Here's a brief list:


- `IntCal04 Supplemental Data`_ to get the *calibration curves* in
  ``.14c`` ASCII format
- `Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit`_ contains a detailed
  explanation of how to use C14 datings, calibration_ and the non-free
  OxCal_ program, which is available also for Linux
- CALIB_ is a radiocarbon calibration program. A command-line Linux
  version is available (non-free software, but works well)
- Radiocarbon_ is the main international journal of record for
  research articles and date lists relevant to 14C and other
  radioisotopes and techniques used in archaeological, geophysical,
  oceanographic, and related dating
- `IntCal04 Supplemental Data`_ including common used calibration curves
