C14 and calibration resources
=============================

There are some interesting websites to learn about radiocarbon calibration and
related topics. Some of them have been useful during the development of this
software.

Other software
--------------

- OxCal_ is developed by the RLAHA at Oxford
- CALIB_ is a radiocarbon calibration program. A command-line Linux
  version is available (non-free software, but works well)
- BCal_ is an on-line Bayesian radiocarbon calibration tool hosted by
  the Department of Probability and Statistics at the University of
  Sheffield.

Reference websites
------------------

- `Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit`_ contains a detailed explanation of how
  to use C14 datings and how calibration_ works
- Radiocarbon_ is the main international journal of record for research
  articles and date lists relevant to 14C and other radioisotopes and
  techniques used in archaeological, geophysical, oceanographic, and related
  dating techniques
- `radiocarbon WEB-info`_ provides online information concerning the
  radiocarbon dating method

Calibration curves
------------------

- `IntCal13 Supplemental Data`_ to get the most recent **calibration
  curves** in ``.14c`` ASCII format
- `IntCal09 Supplemental Data`_ is the previous version of the same
  data

.. _`IntCal13 Supplemental Data`: http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal13.htm
.. _`IntCal09 Supplemental Data`: http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal09.htm
