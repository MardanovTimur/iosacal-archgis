C14 and calibration resources
=============================

There are some interesting websites to learn about radiocarbon calibration and
related topics. Some of them have been useful during the development of this
software.

Other software
--------------

- OxCal_ is developed by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit: it's
  by far the most used calibration program
- CALIB_ is a radiocarbon calibration program. A command-line Linux
  version is available (non-free software, but works well)
- BCal_ is an on-line Bayesian radiocarbon calibration tool hosted by
  the Department of Probability and Statistics at the University of
  Sheffield

Reference websites
------------------

- `Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit`_ contains a detailed explanation of how
  to use C14 datings and how calibration_ works
- Radiocarbon_ is the main international journal of record for research
  articles and date lists relevant to 14C and other radioisotopes and
  techniques used in archaeological, geophysical, oceanographic, and related
  dating techniques
- `radiocarbon WEB-info`_ provides online information concerning the
  radiocarbon dating method

Calibration curves
------------------

Calibration curves are released in the public domain and can be
downloaded in their native format, a slightly customised CSV:

- `IntCal13 Supplemental Data`_ to get the most recent **calibration
  curves** in ``.14c`` ASCII format
- `IntCal09 Supplemental Data`_ is the previous version of the same
  data

.. _`IntCal13 Supplemental Data`: http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal13.htm
.. _`IntCal09 Supplemental Data`: http://www.radiocarbon.org/IntCal09.htm

Please note that IOSACal already includes the calibration curves listed below:

- *IntCal13*
- *Marine13*
- *ShCal13*
- *IntCal09*
- *Marine09*
- *IntCal04*
- *Marine04*
- *ShCal04*
- *IntCal98*
- *Marine98*

Older calibration curves are useful to reproduce calibration results
found in published literature.

Radiocarbon databases
---------------------

There are a few databases of radiocarbon dates that are available as
**open data**, and can be easily downloaded as CSV files for further processing.

- `EUROEVOL <http://openarchaeologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/joad.40/>`_
- `Mediterranean radiocarbon dates <http://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/project/MedRadiocarbon/>`_

Both databases are useful to experiment with many dates and apart from
their specific research aims and spatio-temporal coordinates, they are
incredibly useful as a learning resource.

Other databases are usually released under restrictive license terms
or unavailable to the public.
