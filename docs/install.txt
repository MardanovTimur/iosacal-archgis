 Installation
==============

Simple things simple: to run IOSACal you need the following software
on your computer:

- Python_
- NumPy_
- Matplotlib_

All are available for major platforms. Order of installation matters.

.. _Python: http://www.python.org/
.. _NumPy: http://numpy.scipy.org/
.. _Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/


Download
--------

As of version 0.3 (released in 2016) IOSACal is in beta stage. You can always
get the *development version* from the `git repository`_, either with the
`complete project history`_ or download the latest *released version* as a
simple `source archive`_.

.. _`git repository`: https://gitlab.com/iosa/iosacal/
.. _`complete project history`: https://gitlab.com/iosa/iosacal/commits/master
.. _`source archive`: https://gitlab.com/iosa/iosacal/repository/archive.zip?ref=v0.3

Installing
----------

Just extract the downloaded archive, move to the main directory and::

     python setup.py install

from the main directory. Using pip_ and virtualenv_ is strongly
recommended.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/

After the install has completed, the ``iosacal`` binary will be available.


Specific operating system instructions
--------------------------------------

Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From a terminal::

  sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib

(this installs also Python, Numpy and all other requirements).

Windows
~~~~~~~

You might find more convenient to use a dedicated Python distribution
instead of separately installing all packages:

- `Enthought Python Distribution`_ (a commercial distribution for
  scientific computing)
- `Python(x,y)`_ (a free distribution for scientific and engineering
  computing)

.. _`Enthought Python Distribution`: http://enthought.com/products/epd.php
.. _`Python(x,y)`: http://www.pythonxy.com/
