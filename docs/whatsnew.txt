 What's new in IOSACal
=======================

Release news for IOSACal.

Release 0.3 (in development)
============================

- use ``genfromtxt`` to import calibration curves
- intervals as a well-defined type
- extra properties for ``R`` and ``CalAge`` objects (a simple JSON-like dict)

Release 0.2 (current)
=====================

Main highlights:

- new function to combine multiple determinations (Ward & Wilson 1978)
- a simple and straightforward set of commands to get started
- amazing interactive mode with IPython Notebook
- plotting multiple dates in a stacked plot actually works
- added several older calibration curves (useful to check published data)

On the technical side:

- works with Python 3 only, dropped compatibility with Python 2
- requires NumPy 1.8 and Matplotlib 1.3
- calibration curves and calibrated ages are ``ndarray`` objects, super-easy
  to work with

Known issues:

- AD/BC dates in output are not available, all dates are given as CalBP
