What it does
============

GNUCal is based on currently available calibration methods, like
those described in [RAM2008]_.

GNUCal takes a radiocarbon determination, typically composed by a
date in years BP (before present, i.e. before 1950 AD) and a standard
deviation measure.

The main task of the calibration process is to convert this measure
into a calendar date by means of a calibration curve. GNUCal reads
calibration curves in the common ``.14c`` format used also by OxCal
and CALIB for better compatibility. Should you have calibration data
in another format, it would be easy to either convert them to that
format or modify the source code of GNUCal to adapt it to your needs.

GNUCal can output calibration results either to the console or to
an image with plots and probability intervals.
