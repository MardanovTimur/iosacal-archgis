=============

The current version of GNUCal is in alpha state (i.e. not suitable for
production use), but has already all the basic functionality, like
calibration, generation of publication-quality plots and determination
of probability intervals.

Command line options
--------------------

GNUCal works from the command line. These are the available options.

.. program:: gnucal-cli.py

.. cmdoption:: -h 

   Show an help message and exit

.. cmdoption:: -d <date>, --date=<date>

   Non-calibrated radiocarbon BP date for the sample

.. cmdoption:: -s <sigma>, --sigma=<sigma>

   Standard deviation for the non-calibrated date given with the
   above option

.. cmdoption:: -c <curve>, --curve=<curve>

   Calibration curve to be used [default: ``intcal04.14c``]

.. cmdoption:: -o, --oxcal

   Draw plots more OxCal-like looking [default: False]

.. cmdoption:: -i, --interpolate

   Interpolate calibration curve to obtain fine-grained dating
   intervals [default: False]

.. cmdoption:: -n <name>, --name=<name>

   Name of sample, used also for output image [default: gnucal]

BP or BC/AD dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these two mutually exclusive options to choose which type of dates
you like as output.

.. cmdoption:: --bp

   Express date in Calibrated BP Age (default action)

.. cmdoption:: --ad

   Express date in Calibrated BC/AD Calendar Age


Single and multiple plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these two options when more than 1 sample is supplied to choose
which output is generated.

.. cmdoption:: -1, --single

   Generate single plots for each sample (default)

.. cmdoption:: --no-single

   Don't generate single plots for each sample

.. cmdoption:: -m, --multiple

   Generate compound plot with all samples


Basic usage
-----------

GNUCal is not (yet) a complete Python package, so to use it, just extract files
from the archive and ``cd gnucal``. The command line program is called
``gnucal-cli.py``.

The typical usage is::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -p

The result is saved into the image named ``gnucal_790±60.png``. It
will look more or less like this:

.. image:: /images/image_790±60.png

Other calibration curves
------------------------

By default, ``gnucal.py`` tries to use the *IntCal04* calibration
curve, looking for a file named ``intcal04.14c`` in the same directory
where it is executed. GNUCal is however able to read *any* calibration
curve that uses the same format as ``intcal04.14c``, like those
available on <http://www.radiocarbon.org/>. If you need to use another
calibration curve than the *IntCal04* one, just download it and make
sure it's in the same directory of the main executable.

To specify a calibration curve, use the ``-c`` command line option::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -p -c marine04.14c

We're working on a script to automate the download of such calibration
data, or obtain an authorization for distributing the original files
with GNUCal.

Interpolation
-------------

The standard *IntCal04* calibration curve [REI2004]_ has a varying resolution
over the 26k calendar years it covers, starting with 20 years spaced values up
to the 5 years resolution available from 12k BP onwards. Other curves show
similar patterns.

This means that the output intervals will follow these limitations. It's
possible to use linear interpolation to get more fine-grained results,
particularly concerning probability intervals.

Use the ``-i`` flag to activate interpolation::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -p --ad -i

GNUCal makes use of the **SciPy** library for interpolating calibration curves.
Even if SciPy is not required for GNUCal's normal usage and interpolation is
disabled by default, installing SciPy is recommended.

Multiple dates
--------------

It is also possible to give GNUCal more than one radiocarbon determination,
to see how 2 or more samples relate between themselves.

To use the multiple dates feature, just pass more ``-d`` and ``-s`` options
on the command line::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p

The order in which values are passed to GNUCal matters, so the first
date will be matched to the first standard deviation and so on.

This way, you will get 3 different single plots. If you want to obtain
also a compound plot, add the ``-m`` flag::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p -m

It's also useful to use the ``-n`` option to give a name to the image, and
also a title to the plot::

    ./gnucal-cli.py -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p -m -n "Donetta"
