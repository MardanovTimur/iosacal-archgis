The current version of IOSACal is in alpha state (i.e. not suitable for
production use), but has already all the basic functionality, like
calibration, generation of publication-quality plots and determination
of probability intervals.

Download
--------

As a software, IOSACal is still in its infancy. The 0.1 version will be
released soon, but in the meantime you can get the development version from
bitbucket_, either with the `complete project history`_ or as a simple `source
archive`_.

.. _bitbucket: http://bitbucket.org/steko/iosacal/
.. _`complete project history`: http://bitbucket.org/steko/iosacal/overview/
.. _`source archive`: http://bitbucket.org/steko/iosacal/get/tip.bz2

Installing
----------

Just extract the downloaded archive, move to the main directory and::

     python setup.py install

from the main directory. Using pip_ and virtualenv_ is strongly
recommended.

.. _pip: http://pip.openplans.org/
.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

After the install has completed, the ``iosacal`` binary will be available.

Command line options
--------------------

IOSACal works from the command line. These are the available options.

.. program:: iosacal

.. cmdoption:: -h 

   Show an help message and exit

.. cmdoption:: -d <date>, --date=<date>

   Non-calibrated radiocarbon BP date for the sample

.. cmdoption:: -s <sigma>, --sigma=<sigma>

   Standard deviation for the non-calibrated date given with the
   above option

.. cmdoption:: -c <curve>, --curve=<curve>

   Calibration curve to be used [default: ``intcal09``]

   If you want to specify a different calibration curve provide the
   curve canonical name in lower case (e.g. ``intcal09``, ``marine09``).

.. cmdoption:: -i, --interpolate

   Interpolate calibration curve to obtain fine-grained dating
   intervals [default: False]

.. cmdoption:: -n <name>, --name=<name>

   Name of sample, used also for output image [default: iosacal]

BP or BC/AD dates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use these two mutually exclusive options to choose which type of dates
you like as output.

.. cmdoption:: --bp

   Express date in Calibrated BP Age (default action)

.. cmdoption:: --ad

   Express date in Calibrated BC/AD Calendar Age

Plotting options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. cmdoption:: -p, --plot

   Create one or more plots (see `Single and multiple plots`_) instead
   of the text output.

.. cmdoption:: -o, --oxcal

   Draw plots more OxCal-like looking [default: False]


Single and multiple plots
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Use these two options when more than 1 sample is supplied to choose
which output is generated.

.. cmdoption:: -1, --single

   Generate single plots for each sample (default)

.. cmdoption:: --no-single

   Don't generate single plots for each sample

.. cmdoption:: -m, --multiple

   Generate compound plot with all samples


Basic usage
-----------

The command line program is called ``iosacal``. It can generate both
text output and image plots.

The typical usage is::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60

Output will look like the following:

.. highlight:: rest

::

   ==============
    IOSACal v0.1
   ==============

   Atmospheric data from Reimer et al (2009);

   Radiocarbon determination (BP): 790 ± 60 BP

   Calibrated date
   ---------------

   68.2% probability
    BP 760 ‒ BP 755 (5.2 %)
    BP 740 ‒ BP 675 (61.2 %)

   95.4% probability
    BP 900 ‒ BP 865 (4.6 %)
    BP 825 ‒ BP 815 (1.4 %)
    BP 800 ‒ BP 655 (88.9 %)


If you want an image instead of text output, just add the ``-p`` flag::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -p

The result will be saved into the image file named
``iosacal_790±60.pdf`` in the same directory. It will look more or less
like this:

.. image:: /images/image_790±60.png

Other calibration curves
------------------------

By default, ``iosacal`` uses the *IntCal09* calibration curve. IOSACal
is however able to read *any* calibration curve that uses the same
format as ``intcal09.14c``, like those available on
<http://www.radiocarbon.org/>. If you want to specify a different
calibration curve provide the curve canonical name in lower case
(e.g. ``intcal09``, ``marine09``).

To specify a calibration curve, use the ``-c`` command line option::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -p -c marine09


.. todo::

   Rewrite this section about other calibration curves once we have
   received authorization to distribute calibration data files.


Interpolation
-------------

The standard *IntCal09* calibration curve has a varying resolution: data
spacing changes from 5 years for the range from 0 to 11.2 to cal kBP, 10 yrs
for 11.2–15 cal kBP, 20 yrs for 15–25 cal kBP, 50 yrs for 25–40 cal kBP, and
100 yrs for 40–50 cal kBP [REI2009]_.

This means that the output intervals will follow these limitations. It's
possible to use linear interpolation to get more fine-grained results,
particularly concerning probability intervals.

Use the ``-i`` flag to activate interpolation::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -p --ad -i

IOSACal makes use of the **SciPy** library for interpolating calibration curves.
Even if SciPy is not required for IOSACal's normal usage and interpolation is
disabled by default, installing SciPy is recommended.

Multiple dates
--------------

It is also possible to give IOSACal more than one radiocarbon determination,
to see how 2 or more samples relate between themselves.

.. warning::

   Currently IOSACal doesn't perform any Bayesian matching of
   calibrated ages. This feature will be added in future versions.

To use the multiple dates feature, just pass more ``-d`` and ``-s`` options
on the command line::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p

The order in which values are passed to IOSACal matters, so the first
date will be matched to the first standard deviation and so on.

This way, you will get 3 different single plots. If you want to obtain
also a compound plot, add the ``-m`` flag::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p -m

It's also useful to use the ``-n`` option to give a name to the image, and
also a title to the plot::

    iosacal -d 790 -s 60 -d 917 -s 55 -d 1005 -s 45 -p -m -n "Donetta"
