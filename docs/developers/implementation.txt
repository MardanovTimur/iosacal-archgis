 Implementation
================

IOSACal is written in the Python_ programming language, and it makes
heavy use of the NumPy_ library for the internal management of calibration
curves and calibrated samples. Calibration curves, radiocarbon dates
and calibrated curves are handled internally as ``ndarray`` objects,
making it ridiculously easy to manipulate and plot them.

Generation of plots is done through Matplotlib_, another Python
library built on top of NumPy. The optional interpolation is done through
the SciPy_ `interpolate.interp1d`_ method.

Installing the above packages is **needed** in order to run IOSACal on
your computer. SciPy is optional but highly recommended: without it
interpolation will be unavailable.

Development is tracked with Mercurial_, a fast decentralized version
control system. If you want to participate in IOSACal's development, you're
welcome. Please start from the main source repository at bitbucket_.
