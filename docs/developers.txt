================

IOSACal is written in Python_ 3, and it makes heavy use of the NumPy_
library for the internal management of calibration curves and
calibrated samples. Calibration curves, radiocarbon dates and
calibrated curves are handled internally as ``ndarray`` objects,
making it ridiculously easy to manipulate and plot them.

Generation of plots is done through Matplotlib_, another Python
library built on top of NumPy. The optional interpolation is done through
the SciPy_ `interpolate.interp1d`_ method.

Installing the above packages is **needed** in order to run IOSACal on
your computer. SciPy is optional but highly recommended: without it
interpolation will be unavailable.

Development happens in a public git repository at GitLab_:
