================

IOSACal is written in Python_ 3, and it makes heavy use of the NumPy_ library
for the internal management of calibration curves and calibrated samples.
Calibration curves, radiocarbon dates and calibrated curves are handled
internally as ``ndarray`` objects. ``ndarray`` objects are matrices that can be
easily manipulated through slicing, flipping, summing and other typical
operations.

Generation of plots is done through Matplotlib_, another Python
library built on top of NumPy. Matplotlib can natively read
``ndarray`` objects and plot them in a graphical form. Far from being
just a set of plotting functions, Matplotlib allows the drawing of
complex plots like those created by IOSACal.

Development happens in a public git repository at GitLab_.

Interpolation
-------------

The *IntCal09* calibration curve has a varying resolution: data
spacing changes from 5 years for the range from 0 to 11.2 to cal kBP, 10 yrs
for 11.2–15 cal kBP, 20 yrs for 15–25 cal kBP, 50 yrs for 25–40 cal kBP, and
100 yrs for 40–50 cal kBP [REI2009]_. Other curves follow a similar pattern.

This means that the output intervals would follow these limitations. IOSACal
uses the `interp` function of *NumPy* to perform linear interpolation of the
calibration curves and obtain more fine-grained results, particularly concerning
probability intervals.
